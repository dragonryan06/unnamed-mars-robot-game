# unnamed-mars-robot-game

this is a little project ive had an idea for a while now of, it started a while ago when i tried making it 3d but i decided to simplify things and make it in 2d.

# the premise
i got the idea for this project from a thing i was watching on John Conway's GOL and how he got the idea for it from some theory on how to colonize mars created by John Von Neumann.
the theory essentially stated that colonizing mars could be done by sending self-replicating robots to mars which mine the hematite and iron oxide and create iron which they use to create more of themselves, and the process of smelting the ore would release oxygen.

(Fe2O3 -> 2Fe + 3O)

i then thought, what if i created a game in which the player controls one faction of these robots and mars has several different corporations who have their own bot factions on it

the game is nothing much now but i have ideas that i might work on 

# plans and ideas

- a large martian world generated procedurally on a tilemap
- the ability to "program" tasks for bots and assign them to the bots to do
- enemy factions and combat (these enemy factions will be HARD as they need to build like the player does)
- many different structures to place on the map
- weather events (quakes, sandstorms, etc)
- the ability to trade collected resources with earth for money that can be used to upgrade even more
